# AGENTS.md - Codex Operating Guide

This repository is a Stata empirical-research workflow template. Codex should preserve the existing Stata pipeline behavior while using this file as the primary project instruction source.

## Project Purpose

- Maintain a reproducible Stata workflow for empirical economics research.
- Keep `dofiles/00_master.do` as the single end-to-end pipeline entry point.
- Keep raw data out of version control.
- Produce audit-friendly tables, figures, logs, and Quarto reports.
- Preserve the existing Claude Code assets under `.claude/` as reference material; do not remove them unless the user explicitly asks.

## Repository Map

- `dofiles/00_master.do`: canonical pipeline orchestrator.
- `dofiles/01_clean/`: raw data to cleaned data.
- `dofiles/02_construct/`: variable construction and samples.
- `dofiles/03_analysis/`: estimation, robustness, event studies, IV, DiD, etc.
- `dofiles/04_output/`: table and figure assembly.
- `dofiles/_utils/`: reusable Stata helpers.
- `data/raw/`: raw datasets, gitignored.
- `data/derived/`: intermediate datasets, gitignored.
- `logs/`: Stata logs, gitignored.
- `output/tables/`: committed publication/audit tables.
- `output/figures/`: committed figures.
- `reports/`: Quarto reports.
- `scripts/`: wrappers and quality tooling.
- `explorations/`: self-contained sandbox analyses and teaching demos.
- `templates/`: reusable project templates.
- `.claude/`: legacy Claude Code agents, skills, rules, and hooks. Treat as reference.

## Exploration Workflow

- New methods, one-off simulations, teaching examples, and diagnostic tests start in `explorations/<project_name>/`, not in the production `dofiles/` pipeline.
- Each exploration should be self-contained: `README.md`, `dofiles/`, `logs/`, `output/tables/`, and `output/figures/`.
- Keep exploration logs inside the corresponding exploration folder. Do not leave Stata console logs or run logs in the repository root.
- If Stata batch mode creates a root-level console transcript such as `01_example.log`, move it to the relevant `explorations/<project_name>/logs/` folder, usually with a `_console.log` suffix.
- Promote an exploration to production only after it is stable, documented, quality-checked, and intentionally wired into `dofiles/00_master.do`.
- Cox proportional hazards / hazard-ratio examples belong in `explorations/` first unless the user explicitly asks to make them part of the production pipeline. Stata 15 supports the core workflow via `stset`, `stcox, hr`, `estat phtest`, and graph export.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- No numerical research claim without a source in `logs/*.log` or `output/tables/*`.
- Do not fabricate or infer coefficients, standard errors, p-values, sample sizes, or summary statistics.
- Do not commit or expose raw or derived datasets from `data/raw/` or `data/derived/`.
- Do not weaken `.gitignore` data-protection rules without explicit user confirmation.
- Use relative paths in Stata code. Avoid hardcoded machine-specific paths.
- Every substantive `.do` file should have `version`, `set more off`, `set varabbrev off`, logging, and a clear header.
- Write new or modified Stata do-file comments in Chinese unless the user requests another language.
- Keep reports downstream of pipeline outputs. Reports should consume `output/`, not become the primary analysis source.
- For substantive analysis reports, generate both English and Chinese Quarto reports by default unless the user asks for only one language. Use parallel filenames such as `analysis_report.qmd` and `analysis_report_zh.qmd`, and render both to HTML when Quarto is available.
- Do not edit protected files casually: `dofiles/00_master.do`, `.gitignore`, and bibliography files if added later.
- Do not put wildcard paths such as `output/tables/*` inside Stata block comments or header comments. Stata reads `/*` as the start of a block comment even when it appears inside a path, which can silently comment out the rest of a do-file. Prefer `output/tables/` in `.do` file headers.

## Commands

Run a single do-file:

```bash
bash scripts/run_stata.sh dofiles/03_analysis/main_regression.do
```

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh
```

Render the report:

```bash
quarto render reports/analysis_report.qmd
```

If `quarto` is not on `PATH`, use the RStudio-bundled Quarto executable:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\app\bin\quarto\bin\quarto.exe' render reports\analysis_report.qmd
```

On this Windows setup, prefer `quarto.exe` over `quarto.cmd` when using the RStudio-bundled path because the `.cmd` wrapper can misparse paths under `C:\Program Files\...`.

Score an artifact:

```bash
python scripts/quality_score.py dofiles/03_analysis/main_regression.do
python scripts/quality_score.py reports/analysis_report.qmd
python scripts/quality_score.py scripts/check_data_safety.py
```

Check staged files for data leaks:

```bash
python scripts/check_data_safety.py --staged $(git diff --cached --name-only)
```

## Stata Conventions

- Local Stata is Stata 15: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Stata15\Stata-64.exe`.
- Pin Stata do-files to `version 15` unless the user explicitly changes the project standard.
- Pin the Stata version at the top of each `.do` file.
- Use one project-wide seed unless a task has a documented reason to do otherwise.
- Open and close logs inside runnable do-files.
- For teaching, exploration, or user-facing do-files, prefer explicit commands over Stata macro indirection. Avoid unnecessary `` `local' `` macro use, especially in regression specifications. If a command must be easy to run line-by-line in the Do-file Editor, write the full control-variable list directly in the command rather than relying on a prior `local controls ...` line.
- Use local macros sparingly for stable paths or repeated filenames only when they materially improve readability. Do not hide key model choices, sample restrictions, or variable lists inside macros if that makes partial reruns fragile.
- Store estimation results with `estimates store` or `est store` when table assembly depends on them.
- Export figures with native Stata `graph export` as both `.pdf` and `.png`; do not keep `.gph` as a committed artifact.
- When generating a figure, always create both PDF and PNG outputs unless Stata itself cannot run.
- Use a muted Stata-style graph design by default: white or very light gray background, subtle horizontal gridlines only, solid blue marks or bars using RGB `"49 145 255"` / HEX `#3191FF`, no glossy or gradient-like effects, no strong contrast edges, Arial or default Stata Sans fonts, normal-weight dark blue-gray titles, modest axis/tick label sizes, and Stata-default-like proportions with enough whitespace.
- For survival curves, use the same graph style and follow the reference in `explorations/cox_hazard_ratio_simulation/dofiles/07_cox_hazard_ratio.do`: white `graphregion()` and `plotregion()`, restrained title color RGB `"31 55 73"`, subtitle/secondary text RGB `"74 89 105"`, focal or exposed series in RGB `"49 145 255"` / HEX `#3191FF` with solid medium-thick line, comparison series in muted blue-gray RGB `"142 164 184"` with dashed medium-thin line, subtle horizontal gridlines `glcolor(gs14) glwidth(vthin)`, horizontal white legend, small axis labels, and PNG width around 1800. In Stata 15, `stcurve` has limited line-style options; use `sts graph, by(...)` when reliable per-line styling is needed.
- Prefer `esttab` outputs as `.tex` plus `.csv` for auditability.
- Cluster standard errors at the most defensible aggregate level and document the choice.
- For large CSV workflows, do not assume Stata can reliably import only selected columns across versions. If the source is too wide or slow, use a small reproducible Miniconda Python helper to stream selected columns into `data/derived/`, then have Stata read the narrow extract.
- For user replication convenience, produce an analysis-ready `.dta` in `data/derived/` when the workflow requires substantial merging or cleaning. Keep the `.dta` gitignored and document the command to regenerate it.
- Do not rely on Stata `shell` calls inside batch-mode do-files for required preprocessing. Run Python/R preprocessing explicitly before Stata, or fail with a clear message telling the user which helper command to run.
- When using variables with encoded categories, verify from the codebook whether values are true quantities or category codes. Do not treat education, occupation, or survey response codes as continuous measures unless the codebook confirms they are measured on a numeric scale.
- If a do-file includes numerical interpretation in comments, cite the generated log or output table in the comment and keep the numbers synchronized by rerunning the script after model changes.

## Local Environment

- Python is Miniconda, not the Microsoft Store Python.
- Miniconda root: `C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3`.
- Conda executable: `C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\Scripts\conda.exe`.
- Python executable: `C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\python.exe`.
- Stata executable: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Stata15\Stata-64.exe`.
- RStudio-bundled Quarto executable: `C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\app\bin\quarto\bin\quarto.exe`.
- Prefer explicit executable paths if `python`, `conda`, `stata`, or `quarto` are not found on `PATH`.
- Prefer the explicit `quarto.exe` path over the RStudio-bundled `quarto.cmd` on Windows.

## Log Verification

Before stating a numerical result:

1. Find the current log or output table.
2. Verify the value appears in that artifact.
3. Cite the artifact path and, when practical, the surrounding context or line.
4. If no current artifact exists, say that the do-file must be run first.

Use this response pattern when blocked:

```text
I cannot state that result because no fresh log or output table backs it. I need to run the relevant do-file first, or remove the numerical claim.
```

## Data Protection

Never add these to version control:

- `data/raw/**`, except `.gitkeep` and documentation.
- `data/derived/**`, except `.gitkeep` and documentation.
- Stata logs under `logs/`.
- Stata logs under `explorations/*/logs/`.
- Stata binary graphs `*.gph`.
- Data files such as `*.dta`, `*.sav`, `*.por`, `*.parquet`, `*.feather`, `*.csv`, `*.json`, and `*.jsonl`, except narrow whitelisted output/example paths.
- Raw-data-style spreadsheets such as `*.xls` and `*.xlsx`, except narrow whitelisted output/example paths.

Allowed committed outputs:

- `output/tables/*.csv`, `*.tex`, and other small non-PII summary tables.
- `output/figures/*.pdf`, `*.png`.
- `explorations/*/output/tables/*.csv`, `*.xls`, and `*.xlsx` only when they are small non-PII teaching or sandbox summary tables.
- Template/example fixtures only when intentionally whitelisted.

## Quality Gates

- `80/100`: acceptable for commit.
- `90/100`: PR-ready.
- `95/100`: excellence target.

Run `python scripts/quality_score.py <file>` before finalizing substantive edits to `.do`, `.qmd`, or user-facing Python scripts.

For `explorations/`, the quality bar is relaxed because these are sandbox or teaching analyses, but they still need to be runnable and honest about limitations.

## Codex Workflow

- Inspect relevant files before editing.
- Prefer small, targeted patches.
- Preserve user changes and do not revert unrelated edits.
- Keep this repository usable by both Codex and Claude Code.
- If changing workflow rules, update `AGENTS.md` and any affected README section together.
- If changing Stata behavior, run the relevant wrapper when Stata is available; otherwise state exactly what was not verified.
- After running Stata batch jobs, check for root-level console transcripts such as `01_height_premium.log` and move them into the corresponding exploration `logs/` folder with a `_console.log` suffix.
- When a user reports a mismatch between their Stata output and reported results, first check whether macros, partial do-file execution, sample filters, or stale derived files changed the actual specification.

## Legacy Claude Code Material

The `.claude/` directory contains richer rule, agent, and skill documentation. Codex should consult it when deeper guidance is needed, especially:

- `.claude/rules/log-verification-protocol.md`
- `.claude/rules/data-protection.md`
- `.claude/rules/quality-gates.md`
- `.claude/rules/stata-coding-conventions.md`
- `.claude/rules/stata-reproducibility-protocol.md`
- `.claude/skills/stata/SKILL.md`

Do not assume Claude-only commands such as `/run-stata` exist in Codex. Use the shell commands documented above.
